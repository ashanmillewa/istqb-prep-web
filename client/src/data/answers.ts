      explanation: "a) Is not correct. It is impossible to prove that there are no defects anymore in the system under test. See testing principle 1 b) Is not correct. See testing principle 7 c) Is correct. Testing finds defects and failures which reduces the level of risk and at the same time gives more confidence in the quality level of the test object d) Is not correct. It is impossible to test all combinations of inputs (see testing principle 2)"

      explanation: "a) Is correct. It is important that testers are involved from the beginning of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It will increase understanding of design decisions and will detect defects early. b) Is not correct. Both developers and testers will have more understanding of each other's work products and how to test the code c) Is not correct. End users will not help the testers in increasing the quality of defect reports; also, users usually do not participate in low-level testing levels like integration testing d) Is not correct. Being certified does not automatically mean that the tester will be better in test design"

      explanation: "a) Is correct. This principle means that if the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually these tests no longer find any new defects. This is probably why the tests all passed in this release as well b) Is not correct. This principle says about the mistaken belief that just finding and fixing a large number of defects will ensure the success of a system c) Is not correct. This principle says that a small number of components usually contain most of the defects d) Is not correct. This principle states that testing all combinations of inputs and preconditions is not feasible"

We need two more test cases to cover the two other “floor” partitions. The remaining ”garden type” partition of “no garden” is covered by these tests. We need a total of four test cases: TC1 (ground floor, small garden) TC2 (ground floor, large garden) TC3 (first floor, no garden) TC4 (second or higher floor, no garden) Thus: a) Is not correct b) Is correct c) Is not correct d) Is not correct"

      explanation: "a) Is correct. Since 100% statement coverage is achieved, every statement, including the ones with defects, must have been executed and evaluated at least once b) Is not correct. Coverage depends on what is tested, not on the number of test cases. For example, for code “if (x==0) y=1”, one test case (x=0) achieves 100% statement coverage, but two test cases (x=1) and (x=2) together achieve only 50% statement coverage c) Is not correct. If there is a loop in the code there may be an infinite number of possible paths, so it is not possible to execute all the possible paths in the code d) Is not correct. Exhaustive testing is not possible (see the seven testing principles section in the syllabus). For example, for code “input x; print x” any single test with arbitrary x achieves 100% statement coverage, but covers one input value"

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. The fundamental strength of white-box test techniques is that the entire software implementation is taken into account during testing b) Is not correct. White-box coverage measures provide an objective measure of coverage and provide the necessary information to allow additional tests to be generated to increase this coverage c) Is not correct. White-box test techniques can be used to perform reviews (static testing) d) Is correct. This is the weakness of the white-box test techniques. They are not able to identify the missing implementation, because they are based solely on the test object structure, not on the requirements specification"

      explanation: "a) Is correct. The basic concept behind error guessing is that the tester tries to guess what errors may have been made by the developer and what defects may be in the test object based on past experience (and sometimes checklists) b) Is not correct. Although a tester who used to be a developer may use their personal experience to help them when performing error guessing, the test technique is not based on prior knowledge of development c) Is not correct. Error guessing is not a usability technique for guessing how users may fail to interact with the test object d) Is not correct. Duplicating the development task has several flaws that make it impractical, such as the tester having equivalent skills to the developer and the time involved to perform the development. It is not error guessing"

      correctAnswers: [3],
      explanation: "a) Is not correct. It is often possible to use dynamic testing to cause a test object to fail in ways that could never be achieved by the users, such as by using fault injection. However, if the failure can never occur with real end users, then identifying it is not especially valuable as testing is ultimately aimed at improving the work product for the end users. Spending time testing for failures that cannot occur with real users is not an efficient use of a tester's time. b) Is not correct. Static testing in the form of static analysis is used by developers to identify defects in their code earlier than can be achieved through dynamic testing. Note, however, that static testing (and static analysis) is used to detect defects, not failures, which are found by dynamic testing. Thus it is the use of the term 'failures' that makes this an incorrect option. c) Is not correct. Static analysis directly detects defects in code, and this is normally information for the developer, not the customer. d) Is correct. Reviews are a form of static testing that can be applied from the very start of the software development lifecycle and are used to find defects that can be removed before subsequent development activities waste effort on faulty requirements. If the defects are not detected and removed early on, then when the defect is found in derived work products, such as the design and code, the requirements will need to be changed."

Although testing is a significant part of QC and helps to uncover defects, other (non-testing) techniques utilized in QC include formal methods like model checking and proof of correctness, as well as simulation and prototyping. d) Is not correct.

      explanation: "The 'exhaustive testing is impossible' principle is concerned with the fact that it is not feasible to test every possible variation of inputs in all different circumstances, except in trivial cases. Instead, testing utilizes test techniques, test case prioritization, and risk-based testing to sample from the set of possibilities and focus test efforts. a) Is not correct. The principle states that it is not feasible to test everything except in trivial cases. Testing everything would require testing every possible variation of inputs in all different circumstances, which is generally infeasible as there will be a practically infinite number of possibilities. Testing every possible expected result will not address this problem as the relationship between inputs and expected results can be different for each test object. b) Is not correct. The principle states that it is not feasible to test every possible variation of inputs in all different circumstances. Because for non-trivial systems there is a practically infinite number, documenting all possible input variations would be impractical as it would take an infinite length of time. c) Is not correct. Starting testing as early as possible with reviews and other static testing approaches will not address the problem of there being too many possible test cases. The 'early testing saves time and money' principle is concerned with fixing defects early on to prevent the occurrence of subsequent defects in derived work products. d) Is correct. The use of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis to generate test cases is one way to address the principle as these test techniques provide a systematic way to derive a finite subset of all possible test cases."

      explanation: "a) Is correct. Test design involves using test conditions to create test cases and other necessary testware, such as test data requirements and test charters for exploratory testing. Test environment requirements are also specified, including the necessary infrastructure and tools. b) Is not correct. Test execution involves executing test cases (as part of test procedures), however it does not directly cover the other testware mentioned in the question, such as test data requirements, test environment requirements and test conditions. c) Is not correct. Test analysis is used to identify the features that require testing. The test basis is analyzed and defined as test conditions, which are then prioritized along with related risks. While this activity involves working with test conditions, it does not cover the other testware mentioned in the question, such as test data requirements, test environment requirements and test cases. d) Is not correct. Test implementation includes the generation of test procedures, such as manual and automated test scripts, which are created from test cases and may be assembled into test suites. While this activity involves explicitly working with test cases, and may use test data requirements and test environment requirements, it does not cover test conditions."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. The organization's marketing team is unlikely to perform much testing, so their average level of experience is not likely to impact how testing is performed for a given test object. b) Is not correct. The level of knowledge of users that a new system is being built for them is unlikely to affect how testing is performed. c) Is correct. The number of years' experience of the members of the performance efficiency testing team will help to determine the capabilities and knowledge (e.g., of different tools and defect types) that the team members will apply when they are testing. d) Is not correct. The organizational structure of the different end users will change between users. So, it may not even be known when the application is being tested, and the end user's organizational structure can thus have little effect on how the testing is performed."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Traceability between the mitigated risks and test cases that passed provides little information, because to be mitigated (by testing) the risks would need to have a corresponding test case that passed. To be able to assess residual risk, traceability between all risks and test results needs to be available, so that the risks that do not have a corresponding passing test can be identified as the residual risks. b) Is correct. Traceability between user requirements and test results provides an indication of which user requirements have been tested and so provides a means of measuring project progress (in the context of testing) against business goals. c) Is not correct. It is not clear that test cases that failed provide an indication of tester's skills any more than test cases that passed. It would partly depend on the test objective. Such measurement of testers based on test cases that passed and failed can be counter-productive as it could cause the testers to optimize their testing based on that metric rather than the test objective. d) Is not correct. Traceability between the identified risks and written test conditions provides a means of determining which further test conditions need to be written. Determining which risks are worth testing is part of risk management, and risk mitigation in particular."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Strong communication skills, active listening, and teamwork abilities enable a tester to interact effectively with all stakeholders, however a deep knowledge of a variety of computer games that allowed them to get on well with one developer is not an example of a generic skill useful to testers. b) Is correct. Domain knowledge that can be used to understand and communicate with end-users and business representatives is one of the generic skills required by testers. A tester with experience as a pilot would make them better able to appreciate the acceptance criteria for the helicopter control system. c) Is not correct. Although programming skills could be considered as technical knowledge which can increase efficiency when utilizing some test tools, it is unlikely that these skills would improve their communication with business analysts. d) Is not correct. Although thoroughness, attention to detail, curiosity, and a methodical approach to identifying hard-to-find defects are all useful generic skills for testers, it is doubtful they would be generating test cases prior to starting exploratory testing. This is because one of the main tenets of exploratory testing is that the test cases are generated during the testing, not scripted in advance."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. The whole-team approach allows any team member with the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake any task, however that does not mean that team members can take on any role at any time. Typically, they only take on roles in which they are competent, and there is no suggestion that every team member can do every role. b) Is not correct. The whole-team approach applies to how a single team (typically in Agile software development) works; it does not cover how multiple teams are supposed to work on larger projects, and it does not suggest that only one 'whole' team is needed for a complete project. c) Is not correct. The whole-team approach does not expect every team member to be involved in every important decision. For instance, there is no need for the business representative (i.e., the Product Owner) to be involved in every technical decision that does not affect the business outcome. d) Is correct. By leveraging the diverse skill sets of each team member most effectively, the whole-team approach fosters superior team dynamics, promotes robust communication and collaboration, and generates a team synergy that benefits the entire project."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. In agile software development, deliverables are produced in each iteration, and the frequent delivery of increments necessitates extensive regression testing. Although some (or all) of this regression testing may be automated, the regression testing (automated or not) cannot be replaced by automation of system tests. b) Is correct. If a sequential development model is used, then early in the software development lifecycle no code is available for execution, and so during this time static testing (e.g., reviews) is performed. Later in the lifecycle, when code is available for execution, dynamic testing is possible. Note, however, that preparation for dynamic testing will often occur early in any software development lifecycle. c) Is not correct. If an iterative development model, like agile software development, is used, then component tests may well be used for regression testing for each iteration. In which case, there is a strong argument for automating these component tests, which will have to be run frequently, and there is unlikely to be a strong argument for developers performing these component tests manually. d) Is not correct. In most incremental development models, deliverables are produced in each increment, requiring both static testing and dynamic testing at all test levels for each increment delivered."

DevOps enhances testing in several ways, such as by providing fast feedback on code quality, automated regression testing that minimizes regression risk, and promoting a shift-left approach with high-quality code submission and component tests. This is largely provided through continuous integration, where the developers submit component (unit) tests with their new code, which must pass for the code to be admitted to the build. Therefore, developers do need to complete component testing. b) Is correct. DevOps enhances testing in several ways, such as by providing fast feedback on code quality, automated regression testing that minimizes regression risk, and promoting a shift-left approach with high-quality code submission and component tests. c) Is not correct. DevOps enhances testing in several ways, but testers do not attempt to treat developers and operations equally by spending more time on release testing, although a shift-right approach to testing (testing in production) may well be used. d) Is not correct. Automated processes like continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) in DevOps facilitate stable test environments and reduce the need for manual testing, however, there is a risk of overlooking the importance of manual testing, especially from a user's perspective."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Regression tests increase in number as the project progresses, as new regression tests are typically required as changes are made to the system. Similarly, the number of confirmation tests also typically increases as the project progresses as new confirmation tests are needed for each fix made to a system. b) Is not correct. It is the other way round. Confirmation tests are created and run when the test object is fixed, and regression tests are (ideally) run whenever the test object is enhanced (changed). c) Is not correct. Confirmation testing verifies that a defect has been fixed correctly and so is concerned with testing changes to the test object. However, regression testing ensures that changes (including changes to the operational environment) do not have negative effects on unchanged software and so does not check that the operational environment remains unchanged. d) Is correct.

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. A lack of usability provided through the user interface can be detected through a review using a suitable checklist, but the lack of usability can also be identified by getting several typical users to dynamically test the user interface and provide feedback on its usability. b) Is correct. A code review can detect code that cannot be reached by any path, however dynamic tests can only exercise reachable code and cannot determine that code cannot be reached without running every possible combination of inputs and input states, which is impractical for real code. c) Is not correct. Poor response times for most of the expected users are difficult to determine without executing the code (i.e., by static testing), so in this situation dynamic testing could find a defect, but static testing is unlikely to find it. d) Is not correct. A review of the code by someone who is aware of the required features could detect that the required features had not been implemented in the code, and dynamic testing could also be used to determine that these required features had not been implemented."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. The feedback is from stakeholders (e.g., business representatives and end users), not from developers, so this feedback is not likely to inform managers which developers are more or less productive. b) Is not correct. Early and frequent feedback from stakeholders is not used by project managers to prioritize how they interact with the different stakeholders. c) Is correct. Obtaining feedback from stakeholders early and often in the software development process can be highly beneficial as it facilitates early communication of potential quality issues, can prevent misunderstandings about requirements, and ensures that any changes in stakeholder requirements are understood and implemented sooner. d) Is not correct. Early and frequent feedback can prevent the development of a product that does not meet stakeholder needs, and results in costly rework and missed deadlines, so, ideally there should be no delay. Also, the feedback is from stakeholders (not to them), which includes the end users, so the end users providing feedback will not aid the end users' understanding."

In branch testing, the test cases are derived from knowledge of the control flow of the test object. b) Is not correct. Anticipation of potential defects is used in error guessing (an experience-based test technique), not in branch testing (a white-box test technique). In decision table testing, the test cases are derived from the specification that describes the business logic. c) Is not correct. If a test case is based on the knowledge of the control flow of the test object, it is a white-box test technique. Decision table testing is typically based on an analysis of business logic, so it is a black-box test technique. Branch testing is a white-box test technique, where test cases are derived based on the source code structure. d) Is correct. Decision table testing is a black-box test technique, so it is based on an analysis of the specified behavior of the test object without reference to its internal structure. Therefore, the test cases are independent of how the software is implemented. Branch testing is a white-box test technique, so test cases are based on an analysis of the test object's internal structure and processing.

Each 'Add' event increases it by 1, and each 'Remove' event decreases it by 1. Notice, that when the 'Add' event occurs while being in the NOT FULL state, the state changes to FULL only if N=2. If N<2, the system stays in the NOT FULL state. If N=0, no 'Remove' action is possible. Similarly, if N=3, no 'Add' action is possible. Test a) can be written as E1, E3, E3, E2, E4 (so covers 4 out of 5 valid transitions, achieving 80% valid transitions coverage).

Validating that documented requirements are met is incorrect as validation is concerned with meeting user requirements and expectations, while verification is concerned with meeting specified requirements, so this would be correct if we replaced 'validating' with 'verifying'. b) Is correct. Causing failures and identifying defects is probably the most common objective of dynamic testing. c) Is not correct. Initiating errors and identifying root causes is incorrect because testers do not initiate errors, they try to cause failures. Errors are typically made by developers (and cannot really be initiated) and result in defects, which testers attempt to identify either directly through static testing or indirectly through failures with dynamic testing. Identifying root causes is useful but is part of debugging, which is a separate activity from testing. d) Is not correct. Verifying the test object meets user expectations is incorrect as verification is concerned with checking specified (documented) requirements are met, while validation is concerned with meeting user requirements and expectations, so this would be correct if we replaced 'verifying' with 'validating'."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Dynamic testing does cause failures (from which defects can then be located and fixed). However, debugging is concerned with locating defects and fixing these defects. Therefore, debugging does not fix failures. b) Is not correct. Both testing and debugging contribute to improving the quality of the test object, so both should be considered positively. Debugging is generally considered to be a positive activity as it is fixing something. Dynamic testing does involve intentionally causing the test object to fail, which is why some people consider it a negative activity, but that is a very narrow view. Both positive and negative test cases are possible. Positive test cases check that the test object correctly performs what it is supposed to do, while negative testing checks that the test object does not do what it is not supposed to do. c) Is correct. Testing determines that defects exist either directly through observation of the defect in reviews (or by a tool in static analysis), or indirectly by causing a failure in dynamic testing. Debugging is a separate activity from testing (normally performed by developers) and is concerned with locating defects (only for dynamic testing) and fixing the defects. d) Is not correct. The causes of defects are typically human errors. Testing finds defects either directly through static testing, or indirectly by causing failures in dynamic testing, and debugging fixes defects. So, testing does not find the cause of defects and debugging does not fix the causes of defects."

      explanation: "The 'absence-of-defects fallacy' is concerned with the idea that ensuring correctness in accordance with the requirements (i.e., verifying the absence of implementation defects) does not guarantee user satisfaction with the system. To address this it is also necessary to validate that the system meets users' needs and expectations, fulfills business objectives, and outperforms competing systems. a) Is not correct. The 'testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects' principle explains that while testing can detect the existence of defects in the test object, it is not possible to demonstrate that there are no defects and, therefore, guarantee its correctness. Therefore, explaining that it is not possible for testing to show the absence of defects would partially address this principle, not the 'absence-of-defects' fallacy. b) Is correct. By supporting the end user to perform acceptance testing it should be possible to validate that the system meets users' needs and expectations. c) Is not correct. It is not possible to ensure that no implementation defects remain in the delivered system as the 'testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects' principle explains that while testing can detect the existence of defects in the test object, it is not possible to demonstrate that there are no defects and, therefore, guarantee its correctness. d) Is not correct. Modifying tests that cause no failures to ensure few defects remain is one way to address the 'tests wear out' principle. This principle is concerned with the idea that repeating identical tests on unaltered code is unlikely to uncover novel defects and therefore, modifying tests may be essential. This will not validate that the system meets users' needs and expectations."

      explanation: "Given the following description of test analysis: To identify the features that require testing, the test basis is analyzed and defined as test conditions, which are then prioritized along with related risks. The systematic identification of test conditions as coverage items often involves using test techniques both during test analysis and as part of the test design activity. From the above description, it can be seen that test techniques are often used in the test analysis and test design activities. Boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning are test techniques. a) Is not correct. Test implementation is not likely to involve the use of test techniques as it is mostly concerned with assembling test cases into test procedures, while test techniques create test cases. b) Is correct. Test design is likely to involve the use of test techniques to create test cases from test conditions and coverage items. c) Is not correct. Test execution is not likely to involve the use of test techniques as it is mostly concerned with executing test procedures (and so test cases), while test techniques create test cases. d) Is not correct. Test monitoring is not likely to involve the use of test techniques. Test monitoring is mostly concerned with ongoing checks to ensure the plan is being followed, while test techniques create test cases. e) Is correct.

Although it is correct to say that in Agile software development, some of the test management tasks may be handled by the Agile team itself, the testing role is not primarily the responsibility of a single individual from outside the team. Instead the testing is more likely to be performed by various team members following the whole-team approach. b) Is not correct. The test management role primarily involves activities related to test planning, test monitoring and test control, and test completion. So, although this statement is partially correct, it is wrong to say that the testing role is primarily responsible for test monitoring and test control. c) Is correct. In Agile software development, some of the test management tasks may be handled by the Agile team itself. However, for test activities that span multiple teams within an organization, test managers outside of the development team may perform these tasks. d) Is not correct. The test management role primarily involves activities related to test planning, test monitoring and test control, and test completion, while the testing role is primarily responsible for the technical and engineering aspects of testing, such as test analysis, test design, test implementation, and test execution.

      explanation: "a) Is correct. The primary benefit of independence of testing is that testers are more likely to identify different types of failures and defects compared to developers, due to their varied backgrounds, technical viewpoints, and potential biases, including cognitive bias. However, the main disadvantage of independence of testing is that testers may become isolated from the development team, leading to communication problems, a lack of collaboration, and potentially an adversarial relationship, with testers being blamed for delays and bottlenecks in the release process. b) Is not correct. A developer's familiarity with the code does not mean that they rarely find defects in it, instead this familiarity means they can efficiently find many defects in their own code. And, rather than developers and testers having a shared background, developers having a different background to testers is normally cited as the reason that testers and developers find different kinds of defects. c) Is not correct. Testing can be performed at different levels of independence, ranging from no independence for the author to very high independence for testers from outside the organization. In most projects, multiple levels of independence are utilized. Testers can be in the developer's team and do not need to come from outside the organization. d) Is not correct. Testing can be performed at different levels of independence, however, there is more reason to believe that testers from outside the team are likely to be more isolated from the developers and so are more likely to be blamed for delays in product release."

For instance, there might be a test objective of ensuring that a test object adheres to a contractual requirement that a certain type of testing must be performed before delivery. c) Is not correct.

There is no such thing as the left-hand side of the test process. b) Is correct. Shift left emphasizes the importance of starting testing earlier in the SDLC. Implementing shift left testing necessitates additional training, and increased effort and costs during the early phases of the SDLC, nevertheless, overall savings should be higher. c) Is not correct. Although automated component tests and component integration tests for regression testing are generally valuable, the creation of these tests is normally the responsibility of the developers, and this is not part of shift left which moves testing earlier in the SDLC. d) Is not correct. Training testers to perform tasks early in the SDLC would support a shift left approach by emphasizing the importance of starting testing earlier in the SDLC.

If the checklists are high-level, some variability in the actual testing is likely to occur, resulting in potentially greater coverage but less repeatability.

      explanation: "We want to run test cases according to their priorities, but we also need to consider the dependencies. If we only consider priorities, we want to first run TC 5 and TC 7 (highest priority), then TC 1, TC 3, and TC 4, and finally TC 2 and TC 6 (lowest priority). However, in order to run TC 7, we need to first run TC 4. In order to run TC 5, we need to run TC 4 and TC 2, but TC 2 is blocked by TC 1, which should be run prior to TC 2. So, in order to run priority 1 test cases as early as possible, the first five test cases should be: TC 4 - TC 7 - TC 1 - TC 2 - TC 5. Next, we need to run TC 3, because it has higher priority than TC 6. Thus the full schedule will be TC 4 - TC 7 - TC 1 - TC 2 - TC 5 - TC 3 - TC 6. So, the sixth test case will be TC 3. a) Is correct. b) Is not correct. c) Is not correct. d) Is not correct."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Testing quadrants group test levels and test types separately according to several criteria. They do not represent any combinations of test levels and test types and they are not related to any location within a software development lifecycle. Both test levels and test types are treated separately in the testing quadrants model. b) Is not correct. Testing quadrants group test levels and test types according to several criteria. They do not describe the degree of granularity of individual test types performed at each test level. Such a model, regarding the test levels, is called the test pyramid. c) Is not correct. The statement is wrong, because in general any test type can be performed at any test level. d) Is correct. The testing quadrants group test levels, test types, test activities, test techniques and work products in Agile software development. In this model, tests can be business facing or technology facing. Tests can support the team (i.e., guide the development) or critique the product (i.e., measure its behavior against expectations). The combination of these two viewpoints determines the four quadrants."

When a user reports a software failure, thanks to the unique identification of commits, it is possible to reassemble the files from the software version which was used by the user (as well as the corresponding versions of the test scripts) and thus reproduce the failure and locate the defect faster. b) Is not correct. If a change to the test environment causes unexpected issues during testing, configuration management allows testers to roll back to a previous version of the environment. This ensures that testing can continue without being affected by the change. c) Is not correct. Configuration management ensures that all identified documentation (e.g., requirement specifications) and software items are referenced unambiguously in test documentation (e.g., test plans). d) Is correct.

The important thing that is missing is the identification of the browser and device used for the testing. The browser and device information are important because such a defect can be browser- or device-specific. For example, a login button may work fine on one browser (or one version of a specific browser) but not on another. Therefore, the browser and device information can help the developers to reproduce the issue and find the root cause of the problem more quickly. c) Is not correct.

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. 'The capability of generating test cases without access to the test basis' is not possible. The generation of test cases by either testers or tools requires access to the test basis. b) Is not correct. 'The achievement of increased coverage through more objective assessment' is not a direct benefit of test automation. Test automation will provide more objective assessment of coverage, however that objective assessment will not increase the coverage. Only by using the results of the coverage to write further test cases can the coverage possibly be increased. c) Is not correct. 'The increase in test execution times available with higher processing power' is a contradictory statement as higher processing power would normally reduce execution times, and increased execution times are not a benefit as the testing would take longer. d) Is correct. The prevention of human errors through greater consistency and repeatability is a benefit of test automation as test automation cannot suffer from human errors. For instance, it means that tests are consistently derived from requirements, test data is created in a systematic manner, and tests are executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency."

      explanation: "a) Is correct. The 'tests wear out' principle is concerned with the idea that repeating identical tests on unaltered code is unlikely to uncover novel defects and therefore, modifying tests may be essential. By using test conditions to generate new tests each time, the tests will not be identical and the risk of the tests wearing out is reduced. b) Is not correct. The 'absence-of-defects fallacy' principle is concerned with ensuring that users' needs are fulfilled even if lots of testing is done and no defects are found (i.e., validation is also necessary). The use of test conditions to generate test cases and execute tests does not directly address this concern. c) Is not correct. The 'early testing saves time and money' principle is concerned with fixing defects early on to prevent the occurrence of subsequent defects in derived work products, thereby reducing costs and the likelihood of failures. d) Is not correct. The 'Defects cluster together' principle is concerned with the distribution of defects in a system, which typically follows a Pareto distribution."

      explanation: "a) Is correct. A fundamental strength that all white-box test techniques share is that the entire software implementation is taken into account during testing, which facilitates defect detection even when the software specification is vague, outdated or incomplete.

The fact that the coverage can be precisely defined is not the right reason. The achieved level of coverage would have much more impact than the possibility to measure the coverage. c) Is not correct. If the software does not implement one or more requirements, white-box testing is unlikely to detect the resulting defects of omission. d) Is not correct.

Even if the test results of exploratory testing can be used as a predictor of risk, they are not a good example of reliable defect prediction models that can predict the number of remaining defects. d) Is correct. During exploratory testing, the testers can use any test techniques that they find useful."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Planning poker can estimate effort for a user story that is already written. It does not help in understanding what should be delivered. b) Is not correct. Reviews are not a collaborative user story writing practice. c) Is not correct. Iteration planning is a project-related practice, used to plan the work, not to understand what needs to be delivered. d) Is correct. Conversation explains how the software will be used and often allows the team to define meaningful acceptance criteria, thus obtaining a shared vision of what should be delivered."

      explanation: "a) Is correct. This test case is related to acceptance criteria 2 and 3, because we check if we can set price range (acceptance criterion 2) and if the results update dynamically after adjusting the price range filter (acceptance criterion 3). b) Is not correct. This test case is not related to any of the acceptance criteria. It checks if the filter dynamically sets the default minimum and maximum price range, and not that a customer can do it. c) Is not correct. This test case is not related to any of the acceptance criteria. It checks the currency exchange feature, which is not discussed in this user story. d) Is not correct. This test case is not related to any of the acceptance criteria. It checks the application's compatibility with different browsers, which is not discussed in this user story."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. The approval of the budget is an example of an entry criterion. It would make no sense to approve the budget for some activity that has already been done. b) Is correct. Running out of budget can be viewed as a valid exit criterion. c) Is not correct. Availability of resources is an example of an entry criterion for testing. d) Is correct. Coverage is a measure of thoroughness, so it is a typical exit criterion. e) Is not correct. This is an example of an entry criterion, checked before the project starts."

      explanation: "Using the three-point estimation technique, the final estimate (E) is calculated as: E = (a + 4*m + b) / 6, where a is the most optimistic estimate, m is the most likely estimate, and b is the most pessimistic estimate. a) Is correct. In this case, the estimate for executing a single test case is: E = (1h + 4*3h + 8h) / 6 = 3.5 hours. So, the total time needed for the tester to execute 4 test cases is: 3.5h * 4 = 14 hours. b) Is not correct. c) Is not correct. d) Is not correct."

      explanation: "TC1 achieves the highest coverage (4/7 - Req1, Req3, Req4 and Req7), so should be executed first. Req2, Req5 and Req6 are still not covered. The next test case that achieves the highest additional coverage of the remaining requirements is TC3, covering 2 out of these 3 requirements (Req5 and Req6). So, TC3 should be executed as the second one. Now the only requirement still not covered is Req2, which is covered by TC4. Therefore, TC4 should be executed as the third test case. So, the last test case executed will be TC2. a) Is not correct. b) Is correct. c) Is not correct. d) Is not correct."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Testing quadrants have nothing to do with describing the relationships between test levels. b) Is not correct. Testing quadrants cannot help in assessing any type of coverage. c) Is correct. Testing quadrants allow managers and other stakeholders to understand the relationships between test types, the activities they support (team support or product critique), and the viewpoint they are focused on (business- or technology-facing). d) Is not correct. Testing quadrants is not a psychological model."

      explanation: "Risk assessment can use a quantitative or qualitative approach, or a mix of them. In the quantitative approach the risk level is calculated as the multiplication of risk likelihood and risk impact. So, Risk level = Risk likelihood * Risk impact. Then, Risk impact = Risk level / Risk likelihood. In our case, Risk impact = $1,000 / 50% = $1,000 / 0.5 = $2,000. a) Is not correct. b) Is correct. c) Is not correct. d) Is not correct."

This is one of the purposes of test reports. b) Is not correct. Providing information on the tests executed, their test results, and any defects found is an example of summarizing the test activities performed at a given test level. This is one of the purposes of test reports. c) Is correct. Providing information about defects is the purpose of a defect report, not a test report. d) Is not correct.

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Risk management consists of risk analysis and risk control. Neither of these activities supports the reassembly of the files that made up the release, because these activities deal with risks, not with configuration items. b) Is not correct. Test monitoring is concerned with gathering information about testing to assess test progress and measure whether the exit criteria are satisfied. None of these activities deal with the management of configuration items. c) Is not correct. The whole team approach builds on the tester's skill to work effectively in a team context and to contribute positively to the team goals. So, it focuses on team-related issues, not on configuration items. d) Is correct. Configuration management provides a discipline for identifying, controlling, and tracking work products. Configuration management keeps a record of changed configuration items when a new baseline is created. Using configuration management, it is possible to revert to a previous baseline in order to reproduce previous test results."

      explanation: "a) Is correct. Adding this information allows the developer to use the same input data, so it is more likely they will be able to reproduce the failure quickly and so identify the defect faster. b) Is not correct. Adding the value of Priority will not help in reproducing the defect itself. c) Is not correct. Although some of this information may be of value, adding the memory dumps and database snapshots after each step will be too much, because most of these artefacts will contain useless information for the developer, and make the defect report less readable. d) Is not correct. The question was about helping the developer to reproduce the failure for a specific environment configuration."

      explanation: "Considering each of the listed tool categories: i. Collaboration tools - facilitate communication. Communication does not include the facilitation of test execution. ii. DevOps tools - support the DevOps delivery pipeline, workflow tracking, automated build process(es) and CI/CD. The delivery pipeline and CI/CD both include the facilitation of test execution, such as component testing for CI. iii. Management tools - increase the test process efficiency by facilitating management of the SDLC, requirements, tests, defects and configuration. The management of these items does not include the facilitation of test execution. iv. Non-functional testing tools - allow the tester to perform non-functional testing that is difficult or impossible to perform manually. Non-functional testing can include both static testing and dynamic testing, including test execution. v. Test design and implementation tools - facilitate generation of test cases, test data and test procedures. The generation of this testware does not include the facilitation of test execution. a) Is not correct. b) Is correct. Both DevOps tools (ii) and Non-functional testing tools (iv) facilitate test execution. c) Is not correct. d) Is not correct."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. The detection of additional high-severity defects would be a benefit of test automation, rather than a risk. b) Is not correct. The provision of measures that are too complicated for humans to derive themselves is normally considered to be a benefit of test automation. c) Is correct. If the test automation is incompatible with the development platform, then it will not be able to integrate them, and, for instance, pass test inputs to the test object and receive test results from the test object. d) Is not correct. Substantially reduced test execution times would normally be considered a benefit that is provided by test automation."
