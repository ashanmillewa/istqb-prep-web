    {
      questionId: 1,
      correctAnswer: 2,

    },
    {
      questionId: 6,
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Testing finds defects and failures; debugging is used to locate and fix the causes."

      questionId: 15,
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Human errors can introduce defects in code, which may later cause failures during execution."
    },
    {
      questionId: 16,
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Static testing (e.g., reviews) can identify defects without executing the code."
    },
