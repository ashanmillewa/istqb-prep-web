      explanation: "a) Is correct. Since 100% statement coverage is achieved, every FL-4.3.1 K2 1 statement, including the ones with defects, must have been executed and evaluated at least once b) Is not correct. Coverage depends on what is tested, not on the number of test cases. For example, for code “if (x==0) y=1”, one test case (x=0) achieves 100% statement coverage, but two test cases (x=1) and (x=2) together achieve only 50% statement coverage c) Is not correct. If there is a loop in the code there may be an infinite number of possible paths, so it is not possible to execute all the possible paths in the code d) Is not correct.

Error guessing is not a usability technique for guessing how users may fail to interact with the test object d) Is not correct.

Causing failures and identifying defects is probably the most common objective of dynamic testing. c) Is not correct. Initiating errors and identifying root causes is incorrect because testers do not initiate errors, they try to cause failures. Errors are typically made by developers (and cannot really be initiated) and result in defects, which testers attempt to identify either directly through static testing or indirectly through failures with dynamic testing.

However, debugging is concerned with locating defects and fixing these defects. Therefore, debugging does not fix failures b) Is not correct. Both testing and debugging contribute to improving the quality of the test object, so both should be considered positively. Debugging is generally considered to be a positive activity as it is fixing something. Dynamic testing does involve intentionally causing the test object to fail, which is why some people consider it a negative activity, but that is a very narrow view (and not one typically held by testers). Both positive and negative test cases are possible. Positive test cases check that the test object correctly performs what it is supposed to do, while negative testing checks that the test object does not do what it is not supposed to do c) Is correct. Testing determines that defects exist either directly through observation of the defect in reviews (or by a tool in static analysis), or indirectly by causing a failure in dynamic testing. Debugging is a separate activity from testing (normally performed by developers) and is concerned with locating defects (only for dynamic testing) and fixing the defects d) Is not correct. The causes of defects are typically human errors. Testing finds defects either directly through static testing, or indirectly by causing failures in dynamic testing, and debugging fixes defects.

If the checklists are high-level, some variability in the actual testing is likely to occur, resulting in potentially greater coverage but less repeatability.

Each test level has specific and distinct test objectives as a different form of test object (e.g., single component and complete system) is tested at each test level and overlapping test objectives would lead to unnecessary duplication. b) Is not correct. Test analysis and test design for a given test level should start during the corresponding development phase to facilitate early testing. c) Is not correct. Test design for a given test level should start during the corresponding development phase to facilitate early testing, however test design needs to be based on an agreed test basis, not an early draft. d) Is not correct.

Assuming that testers could check the ease of changing the currency exchange system then it would be done by maintainability testing rather than maintenance testing, so this is not a trigger for maintenance testing. b) Is correct. A system modification (such as a fix or enhancement) is an example of a trigger for maintenance testing. The removal of the refund option of the currency exchange system was a fix that would lead to maintenance testing. c) Is not correct. If the agile team has started developing a user story that adds a new customer loyalty feature, then this will result in them testing the new feature, and then they would perform regression testing.

      explanation: "a) Is correct. A fundamental strength that all white-box test techniques share is that the entire software implementation is taken into account during testing, which facilitates defect detection even when the software specification is vague, outdated or incomplete. This means white-box testing can find defects such as an extra feature added to the code (either accidentally or deliberately) that is not supposed to be there, which black-box testing cannot detect. b) Is not correct. The fact that the coverage can be precisely defined is not the right reason. The achieved level of coverage would have much more impact than the possibility to measure the coverage. c) Is not correct. If the software does not implement one or more requirements, white-box testing is unlikely to detect the resulting defects of omission. d) Is not correct. While this is true, there is no connection between the capability to be used in both static testing and dynamic testing and the claim that white-box testing facilitates defect detection with poor specifications."
