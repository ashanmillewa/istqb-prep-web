      explanation: "a) Is correct. Since 100% statement coverage is achieved, every FL-4.3.1 K2 1 statement, including the ones with defects, must have been executed and evaluated at least once b) Is not correct. Coverage depends on what is tested, not on the number of test cases. For example, for code “if (x==0) y=1”, one test case (x=0) achieves 100% statement coverage, but two test cases (x=1) and (x=2) together achieve only 50% statement coverage c) Is not correct. If there is a loop in the code there may be an infinite number of possible paths, so it is not possible to execute all the possible paths in the code d) Is not correct.

Error guessing is not a usability technique for guessing how users may fail to interact with the test object d) Is not correct.

However, debugging is concerned with locating defects and fixing these defects. Therefore, debugging does not fix failures b) Is not correct. Both testing and debugging contribute to improving the quality of the test object, so both should be considered positively. Debugging is generally considered to be a positive activity as it is fixing something. Dynamic testing does involve intentionally causing the test object to fail, which is why some people consider it a negative activity, but that is a very narrow view (and not one typically held by testers). Both positive and negative test cases are possible. Positive test cases check that the test object correctly performs what it is supposed to do, while negative testing checks that the test object does not do what it is not supposed to do c) Is correct. Testing determines that defects exist either directly through observation of the defect in reviews (or by a tool in static analysis), or indirectly by causing a failure in dynamic testing. Debugging is a separate activity from testing (normally performed by developers) and is concerned with locating defects (only for dynamic testing) and fixing the defects d) Is not correct. The causes of defects are typically human errors. Testing finds defects either directly through static testing, or indirectly by causing failures in dynamic testing, and debugging fixes defects.

Both black-box test techniques and experience-based test techniques can be used at all test levels c) Is correct. Black-box test techniques (also known as specification-based techniques) are based on an analysis of the specified behavior of the test object without reference to its internal structure.

But even if they are, the automated test scripts always execute the tests in the same way, which usually does not result in increased coverage c) Is not correct. It is true that each checklist item should be tested separately and independently. But this impacts the test execution order and does not impact the achieved coverage, and so does not result in increased coverage d) Is correct. If the checklists are high-level, some variability in the actual testing is likely to occur, resulting in potentially greater coverage but less repeatability.

To achieve full valid equivalence partitioning coverage, the two missing partitions are: student discount (0 ≤ D < 18) and pensioner discount (D ≥ 65). a) BY=2001, CY=2065: D=64 → no discount (already covered). b) Is correct. BY=1900, CY=1965: D=65 → pensioner discount (missing partition). c) BY=1965, CY=1900: D=–65 → error message (already covered). d) BY=2011, CY=2029: D=18 → no discount (already covered). e) Is correct. BY=2000, CY=2000: D=0 → student discount (missing partition). Therefore b and e together complete the valid equivalence partitioning coverage."

      explanation: "Two-value boundary value analysis (BVA) tests the boundary value itself and the value just beyond the boundary. The system has two boundaries: the lower boundary at 0°C and the upper boundary at 2°C. a) –1, 3: tests one value just below each boundary but misses the actual boundary values (0 and 2). b) 0, 2: tests only the boundary values themselves but misses the values just outside each boundary (–1 and 3). c) –1, 0, 2, 3: Is correct. This covers both boundaries (0 and 2) AND the values just outside each boundary (–1 just below 0, and 3 just above 2), giving complete two-value BVA coverage. d) –2, 0, 2, 4: Tests boundary values (0 and 2) but the values –2 and 4 are two steps away from the boundaries, not the immediate adjacent values required for two-value BVA."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. 100% statement coverage means every statement was executed, but not every possible failure is guaranteed to be found — some defects only manifest under specific conditions that the test cases may not cover. b) Is not correct. 100% statement coverage does not imply 100% branch coverage; a statement can be executed without testing all possible decision outcomes. c) Is correct. By definition, 100% statement coverage means every executable statement in P has been run at least once. Therefore, any statement that contains a defect will also have been executed at least once. d) Is not correct. Although each test case achieves 50% coverage and they overlap, removing one of three test cases does not guarantee the remaining two still cover all statements — there may be statements only covered by the removed test case."

      explanation: "a) Is correct. White-box test techniques derive tests from the internal structure (code) of the test object rather than from the specification. This means test cases can be created even when the specification is vague, outdated or incomplete, because the tester analyses the actual code paths, branches, and statements to be tested. b) Is not correct. While coverage measurement is an advantage of white-box testing, this does not explain why it works when the specification is poor. c) Is not correct. White-box techniques are actually poor at detecting omissions in requirements, since they rely on what is in the code, not what should be there. d) Is not correct. White-box techniques apply to dynamic testing and some static analysis, but this does not explain defect detection when specifications are incomplete."

      explanation: "Using the three-point estimation formula: E = (O + 4M + P) / 6, where O = optimistic (best case) = 1h, M = most likely = 3h, P = pessimistic (worst case) = 8h. For one test case: E = (1 + 4×3 + 8) / 6 = (1 + 12 + 8) / 6 = 21 / 6 = 3.5 hours. For four test cases: 3.5 × 4 = 14 hours. b) 3.5 hours is the estimate for a single test case, not all four. c) 16 hours would result from simply multiplying the most likely estimate by 4 without applying the three-point formula correctly (4 × 4 = 16). d) 12 hours would result from 4 × 3 (most likely only), ignoring the weighted average formula."

      explanation: "Additional coverage prioritization selects the test case that covers the most additional (previously uncovered) requirements in each round. TC1 covers Req1, Req3, Req4, Req7 (4 requirements) → executed first. After TC1, uncovered: Req2, Req5, Req6. TC3 covers Req5 and Req6 (2 new) → executed second. After TC3, uncovered: Req2. TC4 covers Req2 (1 new) → executed third. TC2 covers Req1, Req5, Req7 — all already covered (0 new) → executed last. Therefore TC2 should be executed last, as it provides no additional requirement coverage after the other three test cases have been executed."

      explanation: "a) Is not correct. Risk management identifies, analyses and mitigates risks to the project, but it does not enable the reassembly of specific software versions. b) Is not correct. Test monitoring and control tracks test progress and makes corrections, but does not manage software versions or file assemblies. c) Is not correct. The whole team approach encourages collaboration across all team members but is not responsible for version tracking and file assembly. d) Is correct. Configuration management is the discipline that maintains information about the version of work products (including software builds and releases). By recording the version number and the associated set of files, the team was able to reassemble the exact release — this is a fundamental outcome of effective configuration management."
